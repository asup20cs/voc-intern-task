## Running The Project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already cloned the project. Now lets run the it

```bash
# install the dependencies
npm install
or
npm i

```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
